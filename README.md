# Ruined Equipment

Grieving equipment owner? Tools and Armors break into Broken forms for memorial purposes.  May you never forget your fallen tools and armors.

**Features**:
- Tools & Armors will become "Ruined" when their durability reaches 0 (and you hear the break sound).
- These are identical in information, but intrinsically useless in purpose.
- Use them to never forget a historic Tool and respect the Tree of Life (tm).

## Place them in Gravesites
