Grieving equipment owner? With this mod installed, Tools and Armors break into Ruined forms for memorial purposes.  May you never forget your fallen tools and armors & the adventures you had with them.

**Features**:
- Ruined varieties of the following Items:
   - All vanilla Tools/Swords
   - All vanilla Armors
   - Misc: Shears, Flint & Steel, Bow, Crossbow, Trident, Fishing Rod
- Tools & Armors will become "Ruined" when their durability reaches 0 (and you hear the break sound).
- These are identical in information, but intrinsically useless in purpose. Enchantment glint and hover tooltip still exist, but the Tool/Armor is functionally useless.
